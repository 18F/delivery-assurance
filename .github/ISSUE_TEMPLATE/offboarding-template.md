### Offboarding

Thank you for your support on the DA Team. Future 18Fers will be grateful for the work you did these past 2 weeks. 

Below is a list of things to do or confirm.

**Onboarding Checklist**
- [ ] **Close tickets:** Prior to moving tickets to “done”, ensure that acceptance criteria in the issue have been met and that it has been peer-reviewed while in the “in-review” column.  In the comments section, provide any documentation detail, next steps, or suggestions. Tag Alan Broulette once the ticket is moved to “done”. [Example](https://github.com/orgs/18F/projects/41/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=20382986)
- [ ] **Hand off in-progress tickets:** Communicate with the team on tickets that may continue to be in-progress before you leave. Include documentation details or suggested next steps in the comments for someone who may pick up the ticket after you. [Example](https://github.com/orgs/18F/projects/41?pane=issue&itemId=20701671). Do not change the status of the ticket or put it back in the backlog, leave them as is.
- [ ] **Create tickets:** Spin up tickets that could be considered follow-on work. Add them to the [DA Repo](https://github.com/18F/delivery-assurance/issues) and note them in the comments of the original ticket. [Example](https://github.com/18F/delivery-assurance/issues/33)
- [ ] **Fill out [the exit survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeREJJ0ceZxS_AOyAiMgKRQiZRgdTondFuJ1ReCYl5wEBmJQg/viewform?usp=sf_link)**
