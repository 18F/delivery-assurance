# 18F Delivery Assurance Team
- The Delivery Assurance Team is a self-organizing team focused on the operation and maintenance of 18F, supporting our products, processes, and teams. (see [intro deck from 3/3/23 team coffee](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NSmRKW_5Krg3DhCYU_6xSTn0fCYgN6KtLcvUJRnUquQ/edit#slide=id.g5ecdbbee9e_0_0))
- This is a revolving team between projects staffed in 2-week increments, based on availability
- There is no guarantee that this team is staffed every 2 weeks, so there is no guarantee on delivery until it's been prioritized


## Stakeholders
- Team Lead: Alan Brouilette
- Executive Sponsor: Kelsey Foley

## How to request help
There are 2 ways work is requested.
1. Create an issue in [the Delivery Assurance repo](https://github.com/18F/delivery-assurance/issues). **Please use the templates**
2. An issue is generated in one of our "connected repos" ([see below](#connected-repos) for full list)

**Use the common issue template to fill out all required information. If the issue has not been filled out, it may not get prioritized**

## How work is prioritized, assigned, and managed
The [Delivery Assurance Shared Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/18F/projects/41) is our main kanban board. It automatically aggregates all issues across the various connected repos into one backlog for prioritization and execution.

Work is prioritized by the 18F Leadership Team, based on the following priorities:
- ≤ 2 weeks
- Correlation to the ranking priorities (bets) of our vision (deliver to the public, increase knowledge sharing, improve operational resilience)
- Urgency and impact

Work cannot be associated with a project without compensation or an agreement.

Example from Feb 2023
| Work | Priority |
|--------|-----|
| Content guide was down | Urgent |
| Weekly billing tock and accessibility bugs | High |
| Guides and Methods support | High |
| Delivery School curriculum support | High |
| Project reflections | Medium |
| Project or practice blog posts | Low |

## Code review
- Pull Requests should have at least one member of this team approve it in order for merge
- Try to have another Engineer look at any tech-heavy PR’s
- It’s helpful to call out in the PR description why someone has been requested for review and to point them towards specific things to look at. 
- When commenting on PR’s as a reviewer, it’s helpful to specify whether your comment is blocking or non-blocking for approval. You can use [Conventional Comments Syntax](https://conventionalcomments.org/) for this if you’d like to 
- Once the PR has been approved, merging can be done by either the reviewer or the submitter, so we don’t have mergeable code waiting around for too long

## Connected repos
- TBD
