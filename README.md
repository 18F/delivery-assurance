# 18F Delivery Assurance Team
We're a working group of 18F peers allocated in 2-week increments to support 18F, started in Feb 2023. We're focused on organizational improvement and sharing knowledge internally and externally.

- Team Lead: Alan Brouilette
- Executive Sponsor: Kelsey Foley

## Priorities

- Work should correlate to the ranking priorities (bets) of our vision.
- Work should prioritize 18F urgent and impactful needs first
- Work cannot be associated with a project without compensation or an agreement.

## How to request help
There are 2 ways work is requested.
1. Create an issue in [the Delivery Assurance repo](https://github.com/18F/delivery-assurance/issues). **Please use the templates**
2. An issue is generated in one of our "connected repos" ([see below](#connected-repos) for full list)

## How work is prioritized, assigned, and managed
The [Delivery Assurance Shared Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/18F/projects/41) is our main kanban board. It automatically aggregates all issues across the various connected repos into one backlog for prioritization and execution.

Work is prioritized by the 18F Leadership Team, based on the priorities listed above.

## Code review
- Pull Requests should have at least one member of this team approve it in order for merge
- Try to have another Engineer look at any tech-heavy PR’s
- It’s helpful to call out in the PR description why someone has been requested for review and to point them towards specific things to look at. 
- When commenting on PR’s as a reviewer, it’s helpful to specify whether your comment is blocking or non-blocking for approval. You can use [Conventional Comments Syntax](https://conventionalcomments.org/) for this if you’d like to 
- Once the PR has been approved, merging can be done by either the reviewer or the submitter, so we don’t have mergeable code waiting around for too long

## Connected repos
- TBD
