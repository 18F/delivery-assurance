# 18F Delivery Assurance Team
We're a working group of 18F peers allocated in 2-week increments to support 18F, started in Feb 2023. We're focused on organizational improvement and sharing knowledge internally and externally.

Team Lead: Alan Broulette
Executive Sponsor: Kelsey Foley

## Priorities

- Work should correlate to the ranking priorities (bets) of our vision.
- Work should prioritize 18F urgent and impactful needs first
- Work cannot be associated with a project without compensation or an agreement.

## How to request help
There are 2 ways work is requested.
1. An issue is generated in [the Delivery Assurance repo](https://github.com/18F/delivery-assurance/issues)
2. An issue is generated in one of our "connected repos"

## How work is prioritized and managed
The [Delivery Assurance Shared Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/18F/projects/41) is our main kanban board. It automatically aggregates all issues across the various connected repos into one backlog for prioritization and execution.

Work is prioritized by the 18F Leadership Team, based on the priorities listed above.
