# 18F Delivery Assurance Team

## Scope

### Background

In Dec 2022, 18F leadership laid out a strategic plan with 3 focused bets. One
of those bets was to “create more value for the partners, GSA, practitioners,
and our own staff if we can share learning from projects more effectively.”

Included in that bet was creating a Delivery Assurance Team to channel efforts
of folks not on project teams towards increasing teaching and learning to 18F,
practitioners, and the public.

### Problem Statement

In the past knowledge sharing and support work was done by 18F employees between
projects. Before being staffed to another project, individuals would identify a
need or a key lesson learned on a project and invest effort pursuing that
subject matter. This method for knowledge sharing and support is completely
dependent on the ambition and tenacity of individuals and it was often
uncoordinated.

This is unsustainable and has resulted in

- Burnout or frustration from 18F employees
- Work that duplicates past efforts
- Problems that aren’t fully resolved or supported by the organization
- Lack of organization and consistent institutional memory

### What this is

- A working group of 18F peers allocated in 2-week increments to support 18F
- Focused on organizational improvement and sharing knowledge internally and
  externally

### What this isn’t

- A guild, collective, or community of practice
- A billable project. Billable work takes priority over this. Staffing may
  draft you to a billable team at any time.
  - This means documentation is key so someone else can pick up work you may
  need to abruptly put down.

### Priorities

**Work should correlate to the ranking priorities (bets) of our vision:**

- Know, share, use and evolve our best practices
- Increase 18F’s operational resilience
- Deliver more value to the public through our projects

**Work should prioritize 18F urgent and impactful needs first, such as:**

- 18F hiring and onboarding support
- Critical bug fixes or communication needs

**Work cannot be associated with a project without compensation or an
agreement.**

### How we know this team is working

| Priority | Goal | We know we’ve succeeded when...|
|--------|-----|-------|
| | Work is being completed | Total # of issues “done” <br />Consistent # of issues “done” every 2 weeks|
|| As a Delivery Assurance Team member, I know that I’m doing important work | Total # of issues tagged with “High or Medium importance” done <br /> Exit survey responses - positive sentiment|
|| As an 18F LT member, I can better delegate and make improvements to our organization||
|| As an 18F employee, I can advocate for work that I feel is important| Total # of issues submitted by 18F employees|

### Risks and considerations

- Increased context switching and deadlines lead to individual burnout
- 2-week term incentivizes short-term fixes for entrenched problems
- Rushed delivery or handoff could perpetuate google drive disorganization or
  redundancy of work

### Stakeholders

- 18F Leadership Team
  - Owner: Alan Broulette
  - Executive Sponsor: Kelsey Foley
- 18Fc Subject Matter Experts (SME) of the work that’s being considered:
  - System owners for bug fixes or documentation
  - The project team for project reflections
  - Etc.

## Charter

### How are people staffed to this team

- Comprised of 18F ICs who are 100% available and unassigned to a project.
- We will not be staffing (at first): 
  - Supervisors, as they are 50% available
  - New hires within first 2 weeks
- As a starting point, we are going to staff the DA team in two-week increments.
  - No one will be removed from the DA team during an assigned period, and
  upcoming projects to which DA team members are staffed will need to
  accommodate this assignment.
- We're going to track this team with [a highly simplified staffing request](https://github.com/18F/staffing/issues?q=is%3Aissue+%2218F+Delivery+Assurance+Team%22):
  Once a week, Monday or Friday, a list in the repo, e.g. Delivery Assurance Team, Feb 6-16.
- All of this is subject to rapid and frequent iteration as we figure out better
  ways to do the work through doing the work.

### How we work together

As this team is loosely constructed around the work rather than individuals, we
need to ensure that our work is discoverable and documented. To that end;

- Our slack channel is #18f-da-team (pin this document to the channel)
- We have a Delivery Assurance [GitHub repo](https://github.com/18F/delivery-assurance)
  where we will collect all related documents.
- We have a Delivery Assurance [shared Projects board](https://github.com/orgs/18F/projects/41/views/1).
  This shared projects board pulls in work from Guides & Methods, Tock, other
  associated repos, and any issues opened in the Delivery Assurance repo.
  - Priority will be established by leadership
- Each iteration of the team will likely be different. Each iteration’s work
  will be determined by the skillset of the current members.
  - On the first day of the iteration, there will be a backlog prioritization
  session. Alan, along with any team members, will determine what work to do
  during that iteration and pull it into the to-do column.

### How we manage / prioritize work

Work is prioritized by the 18F Leadership Team and aligns with the group’s priorities listed above.

The work will be a balance of urgent, incoming asks and non-urgent work that will
slowly further the long-term priorities of the 18F Leadership team. Types of
tasks we anticipate this team taking on include:

- Delivery School development
- Supporting 18F Guides and Methods,
- Tock feature development,
- Running data analysis on project reflections, and
- Other stuff!

| Activity | DA Team | 18F LT | 18F SME | 18F employees|
|----------|---------|--------|---------|--------------|
|Work prioritization | Informed | Driver/Approver | Consulted | Informed|
|2-week planning | Driver/Approver | Consulted | Informed | Informed |
|Execution / Delivery | Driver | Informed | Approver | Informed |

### Assigning work

- Co-own work, especially if many people are excited
  - Avoid “the last mozzarella stick” effect
- Pitch in the grunt and glue work

### How we communicate

- Onboarding is this document!
- A daily check-in to see faces, communicate about work-in-flight, and bring
  up any foreseeable risks or blockers.
- Any important news or information disseminated in meetings should be added
  to the slack channel for reference purposes.
- Communicating early and often in #18f-da-team will be really important,
  especially as we get into a cadence of intaking leadership priorities.
- Regular retros are difficult because of the impermanence of the team, but it
  is still important to document successes and failures in able to learn and
  grow from them.
  - Exit survey?
  - Something else?

### How we document and transition

- All work will be documented as an issue and pulled into the [shared Projects board](https://github.com/orgs/18F/projects/41/views/1).
- Draft documentation can be temporarily hosted in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ik7qWIZaDA-GpJmkSy6BmcNIznCnWB65?usp=share_link)
- Label [DRAFTS] appropriately and add Front Matter for posterity (background,
  goals, who’s worked on this, etc.)
- Upon completion documentation should be moved to the relevant folder for
  posterity, or archived in Google Drive.
- All work requests are documented as an issue
  - [Template](TBD) includes:
    - Title
    - Description
      - Related issues
    - How it maps to org priorities
    - Definition of Done (checklist)
    - Important links
    - Important dates
    - People involved
      - Approver
    - Why is this important?
  - Tags:
    - Priority: High, Medium, Low
    - Experience needed: Eng, Design, Acq, Product, AM, Operations
  - Owner closes and cleans up all issues at the end of 2 weeks
    - Owner ensures that next steps are clearly documented
- Use issue comments for updates, rolloff, and handoff

### Ceremonies and Rituals

- Daily Check-In - 12pm EST, 9am PST every week day
  - Purpose: TBD, semi-stand up, access to leadership on background or
  decisions, task management
- Co-working - scheduled on an adhoc basis
  - Purpose: do the work, together

### Principles

- Golden Rule: Document unto others as you would have them document unto you
- Find a co-owner, don’t work by yourself
  - Minimum: All work should be peer-reviewed by another DA team member
- Try or learn something new - pair with people you wouldn’t work with on
  topics you wouldn’t normally pursue
- Don’t bite off more than you can chew in 2 weeks
- Don’t start the work right away. Meet with the stakeholders before you start
  executing to double check the objectives, goals, and timeline (things change)
