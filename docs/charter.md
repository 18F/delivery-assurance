# 18F Delivery Assurance Team

## Scope

### Background

In Dec 2022, 18F leadership laid out a strategic plan with 3 focused bets. One
of those bets was to “create more value for the partners, GSA, practitioners,
and our own staff if we can share learning from projects more effectively.”

Included in that bet was creating a Delivery Assurance Team to channel efforts
of folks not on billable project teams towards increasing teaching and learning to 18F,
practitioners, and the public.

### Problem Statement

In the past knowledge sharing and support work was done by 18F employees between
projects. Before being staffed to another project, individuals would identify a
need or a key lesson learned on a project and invest effort in capturing these lessons 
learned for the benefit of future project teams. This method for knowledge sharing and support is completely
dependent on the ambition and tenacity of individuals and it was often
uncoordinated.

This is unsustainable and has resulted in

- Burnout or frustration from 18F employees
- Work that duplicates past efforts
- Problems that aren’t fully resolved or supported by the organization
- Lack of organization and consistent institutional memory

### Priorities

**Work should correlate to the ranking priorities (bets) of our vision:**

- Deliver more value to the public through our projects
- Know, share, use and evolve our best practices
- Increase 18F’s operational resilience

**Work should prioritize 18F urgent and impactful needs first, such as:**

- 18F hiring and onboarding support
- Critical bug fixes or communication needs

**Work cannot be associated with a project without compensation or an
agreement.**

## Charter

### How are people staffed to this team

- Comprised of 18F staff who are 100% available and unassigned to a project.
- We will not be staffing (at first): 
  - Supervisors, as they are 50% available
  - New hires within first 2 weeks
- As a starting point, we are going to staff the DA team in two-week increments.
  - No one will be removed from the DA team during an assigned period, and
  upcoming projects to which DA team members are staffed will need to
  accommodate this assignment
- We're going to track this team with [a highly simplified staffing request](https://github.com/18F/staffing/issues?q=is%3Aissue+%2218F+Delivery+Assurance+Team%22):
  Once a week, Monday or Friday, a list in the repo, e.g. Delivery Assurance Team, Feb 6-16
- All of this is subject to rapid and frequent iteration as we figure out better
  ways to do the work through doing the work

### How we work together

As this team is loosely constructed around the work rather than individuals, we
need to ensure that our work is discoverable and documented. To that end;

- Our slack channel is #18f-da-team (pin this document to the channel)
- We have a Delivery Assurance [shared Projects board](https://github.com/orgs/18F/projects/41/views/1).
  This shared projects board pulls in work from Guides & Methods, Tock, other
  associated repos, and any issues opened in the Delivery Assurance repo
- We have a Delivery Assurance [GitHub repo](https://github.com/18F/delivery-assurance)
  where we will collect all related documents
- All work should be submitted as an issue, either in the Delivery Assurance 
  Github repo or in one of the associated repos
- Prior to the next 2-week sprint, 18F Leadership members and the Team Lead will get
  together to write out [goals](url), project team make-up, and refine the backlog
- On the first day of the sprint, there will be a backlog prioritization
  session. The delivery assurance team will determine what work to do
  during that sprint and pull it into the Ready column
- The Delivery Assurance Lead ensures that all issues are up to date at the 
  end of 2 weeks and next steps are clearly documented
- We use issue comments for updates, rolloff, and handoff
- Each iteration of the team will likely be different. Each iteration’s work
  will be determined by the skillset of the current members


### How we prioritize work

The 18F Leadership Team prioritizes the work.

The work will be a balance of urgent, incoming asks and non-urgent work that will
slowly further the long-term priorities of the 18F Leadership team. Types of
tasks we anticipate this team taking on include:

- Delivery School development
- Supporting 18F Guides and Methods
- Tock feature development
- Running data analysis on project reflections
- Other stuff

| Activity | DA Team | 18F LT | 18F SME | 18F employees|
|----------|---------|--------|---------|--------------|
|Work prioritization | Informed | Driver/Approver | Consulted | Informed|
|2-week planning | Driver/Approver | Consulted | Informed | Informed |
|Execution / Delivery | Driver | Informed | Approver | Informed |

### How we communicate

- Onboarding is this document!
- A daily check-in to see faces, communicate about work-in-flight, and bring
  up any foreseeable risks or blockers
- Any important news or information disseminated in meetings should be added
  to the slack channel for reference purposes
- Communicating early and often in #18f-da-team will be really important,
  especially as we get into a cadence of intaking leadership priorities
- Regular retros are difficult because of the impermanence of the team, but it
  is still important to document successes and failures in able to learn and
  grow from them
  - TBD: Exit survey / Demo

### Ceremonies and Rituals

- Daily Check-In - 12pm EST, 9am PST every week day (for now)
  - Purpose: TBD, semi-stand up, access to leadership on background or
  decisions, task management
- Co-working - scheduled on an adhoc basis
  - Purpose: do the work, together

### Principles

- Work in the open.
- Understand we are building this as we go
- Avoid edge casing
- Always be thinking about documentation
- Ask questions
- Don't borrow trouble from next week
- Golden Rule: Document unto others as you would have them document unto you
- Find a co-owner, don’t work by yourself
  - Minimum: All work should be peer-reviewed by another DA team member
- Try or learn something new - pair with people you wouldn’t work with on
  topics you wouldn’t normally pursue
- Don’t bite off more than you can chew in 2 weeks
- Don’t start the work right away. Meet with the stakeholders before you start
  executing to double check the objectives, goals, and timeline (things change)
